Custom Hooks
   Special JS Functions, utility/helper functions

   asbtracting the whole logic into a file and just using a hook that directly returns required data
   example, 
   const data = useRestrauntMenu(resId) Hook -> just give the data and logic is in another file

   Creating:
      inside utils, new file for each , starts with use......()

      Use-> if user is offline, on clicking anything just give-> "you are offline"

   RULES/FLOW to write a hook =>
      -finalise input & output


==================================================================================================
Single responsibility principle => Each component must have just single responsibility, if there are more break it into modules
      makes code -> reusable, maintainable , testable
      keeping components as light as possible

   example , we have useParams inside RestrauntMenu, this component should just display the data and not fetch and all things

OPTIMIZATION:::::


   bundlers(parcel,vite etc) compress whole code into 1html, 1 js and 1 css file. 
   for large files, this js can be very big if the wite has many components , we dotn need to load all at once
   so we split and load just the required part ,which is called : 
   CHUNKING    ,  LAZY LOADING   ,  CODE SPLITTING    ,  DYNAMIC BUNDLING   ,    ON DEMAND LOADING
   that is we need to do splitting of js files that a bundler gives

   Logical bundling is what we need to do, ie give enough fetures for a bundle to run everything required
      ex for swiggy-> bundles according to [food, instamart, dineout, ticket-booking etc..]

   WE DO IT BY:
      not importing directly-
         import Stuff from "path-of-stuff"
      we use lazy , lazy is named import from react
         const stuff = laxy(()=>   import("path-of-stuff")  )

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   SUSPENSE
   LOADING LAZY COMPONENTS:

      when we go to some component which is to be lazy loaded, browser calls it after clicking and it takes some time for the code to come 
      now in meantime, react tries to render the component which is basent at the instacne and thus throw error
      to resolve this, we use Suspend(import named from react)
      we wrap lazy imported componend inside suspense:
         <Suspense fallback={<Shimmer/>}>  <ComponentToBeLoaded>  <Suspense/>

         and in the suspense, we need to give a fallback attribute, that is loading screen rendered in meantime before getting the lazy component.
