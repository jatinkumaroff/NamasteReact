Reconsiliation Algorithm (React Fiber)  => finds DIFF and UPDATES DOM

    if form 7 card, we're filtering to 3 cards our UI changes
    
    from the DOM, react creates "VIRTUAL DOM" ie representation of actual DOM   
                (actual DOM = object that is being rendered)


DIFF ALGORITHM:
    finds out difference bw 2 virtual DOMS
        difference in previous virtual DOM(7 elements) and new virtual DOM(3 elements)
        and then it updates the actual DOM


Q. WHY REACT IS FAST?
A. "USES INCREMENTAL RENDERING"

Q. What is React Fiber
A. REACT FIBER IS RECONCILLIATION ALGORITHM WHICH USES DIFFING AND UPDATES ONLY CHANGED COMPONENTS IN DOM



       STATE VARIABLE:
                use useState to change this
                always use setNameButton => after doing this:

        ######## CHANGING STATE RETURNS THE WHOLE COMPONENT FUNCTION
                 THEN REACT COMPARES OLD VS NEW VIRTUAL DOM, 
                 AND UPDATES ONLY THE DIFF IN REAL DOM

                 THIS IS CALLED RECONCILLIATION  ####################3

                 T0-CLARIFY-THE-ABOVE : COMPONENT FUNCTION RUNS FULLY, but the DOM is not FULLY changes!!!


                 RENDERING != DOM MANIPULATION

                 

06, Search Filtering:
  #########IMP####
        this wont work , because here, the value of search is tied to the variable!
             <input type="text" className="search-box" value={searchText}/>

            so we need an onChange handler: 
                onChange={(e) => {
                    setSearchText(e.target.value);          THIS WONT CHANGE value variable, but searchText
                }}                          

            HERE WE ARE RE RENDERING THE WHOLE COMPONENT ON EACH CHARACTER TYPING!!!!!
