HOOKS INTERNALS:
   
   useEffect(callback, ?optional dependency array);      => ( ()=>{ } , ?[] )
      
    if optional arg:
      is not mentiond : => useEffect is called on every render
      is an empty arr= []: => useEffect is called on just inital render    
      contains a var -> [SearchBTN]=> called when this SearchBTN updates, we can have any number of args in []

   useState(initial data) =>

      can be created inside the functional component only and not outside it
      used as local state variable
      always declared at the top , to avoid undefined conflict
      never declare it insdie if-else/loops/function statements

=========================================================================================
ROUTING::

   Routing Configuration:
      first step before routing , inside App.js 
      using createBrowserRouter from react-router-dom

   takes array of objects with 2 things: [{1,2} , {1,2}]
    const appRouter = createBrowserRouter([
      {
         path:'/',
         element: <AppLayout/>,    -> if path is this, load this
      },
      {
         path:'/about',
         element: <About/>,    -> if path is this, load this
      }
    ])

    we import {createBrowserRouter ,RouterProvider} from "react-router-dom";
    this RouterProvider provides the routing configuration that we use to render pages
    by:
      root.render(<RouterProvider router={appRouter} />);

=============================================================================================================
CUSTOM ERROR PAGE:      -< useRouteError HOOK
   on unknown route or in case of error
      just add errorElement in the path: '/' 
      {
         path:'/',
         element: <AppLayout/>,    -> if path is this, load this
         errorElement: <Error/>
      },

   Customisation:
      HOOK -> useRouteError , import it in error page
      now showing details or error

      in the error.js-> Error componetn function:
         const err = useRouteError();   -> RETURNS WHAT ERROR WE ENCOUNTERED AS OBJECT , SAVED IN err
         console.log(err)

         then inside return , give the err 
         AND USE:   <h3>{err.status}: {err.statusText} </h3>
   
===============================================================================================
CHILDREN ROUTES:
   we can change the body but we need to keep the HEADER , FOOTER and some other stuff intact. so we ened children routes of AppLayout:

   in the createBrowserRouter({
      inside a path, add the children:[] arg and enter the path,element pairs as we did before
      and use <Outlet/> tag in the AppLayout

      the children according to the path will come in place of Outlet component
   })
   Outlet , children array , path 

   BY USING OUTLET-CHILDREN stuff

   we will just re render the Children and not the whole page


====================================================================================
LINK TAG:
   instead of anchor tag, use the link tag , it doesnot refresh whole page
   in react , alway use link tag

   <Link to="/path"> CONTACT US <Link/>


   thus react is a single page application, as wiht react we dont refresh the whole page, we just use routes


      TPYES OF ROUTING IN WEB APPS:

         1. what we do here is CLIENT SIDE ROUTING .we just call APIs , we're not fetching a new page
         2. SERVER SIDE ROUTING - when we make network calls 
===================================================================================
DYNAMIC ROUTING (DIFFERENT PAGES FOR DIFFERENT RESTAURANTS):
   restaurantmenu page -> with dynamic data of each restaurant


   path:"/restaurants/:resID",   => dynamic url
   element: <RestaurantMenu/>

   CAN DO THE MENU PAGE INDEPENDENTLY, 
      in swiggy loading res menu pages, only difference is resId, that we need to pass through the React's router as variable and this will be used while calling APIs woth the specific resId

   Procedure:
     IN RestaurantMenu-
      HOOK => useParams from "react-router-dom"
      Fetched the params in the route, resId in this case

      GIVEs object, destructure it and use in the fetch APIs


=================================================================================================================================
Making Restaurant List Cards clickable:

   use Link - to property and link it by fetching the restaurant id and using it with /restaurant + {resId}

   then it should load the specific Restaurant's Menu Page
