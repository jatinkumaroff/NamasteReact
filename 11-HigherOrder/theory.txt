HIGHER ORDER COMPONENTES:
   components that take a component as input and give component as output

   like in promoted restaurant cards, there is a badge on the corner, it is through these HIGHER ORDER components
   take card as i/p and give card+ribbon as o/p 

   there was no such thing in api rn, so i created logic - if resId%3==0 - treat it as promoted

   MADE THE CARDS CLICKABEL AND INSERTED THE LINKS TO DIRECT SWIFFY WEBSITE, NOW JUST NEED TO CREATE MENU PAGE, TAKE THE LINK AND FETCH MENU AND SHOW IN THAT PAGE INSTEAD OF OPENING DIRECTLY THE SWIGGY PAGE


   WHILE USING HIGHER ORDER COMPONENT, PASS THE PROPS INSIDE WITH THE CARD 
   AND IN CALLING THE ORIGINAL COMPONENT, PASS DESTRUCTURED OBJECT/DATA
   LIKE:    {...props}

   REST REMAINS THE SAME

===================================================================================================

PROPS DRILLING:

   if parent=> child 1=> grandchild 1

   gc1 needs some data present in parent , but child dont need it, the data still has to pass through it
   this is props drilling. 

   we can use context , global place to keep global data, accessible everywhere. 
   ex- loggedInUser, videoplaying in video app, darkTheme


   create seperate js files for every such info, like for all the user info => UserContext.js
   using-> createContext
   inside it:

      const UserContext= createContext({
         loggedInUser:"default value "
      })    => then default export


   ACCESING IT FROM ANYWHERE
   -> using a hook ie  useContext 
      const data= useContext(UserContext)

      it acts as normal object, destructure it and use it anywhere


   -> using <UserContext.Consumer>   {({loggedInUser})=>(here any html code)}  </UserContext.Consumer>

   Modifying context varibale:
      using <UserContext.Provider>     </UserContext.Provider>


      wrap the whole app inside it and pass a prop inside it :
         <UserContext.Provider value={{loggedInUser:"whateverwe want"}}>

      if we wrap just a Headder component inside this:
      -the Header will take the new value
      -other places it will use default value

      we can also use nested <UserContext.Provider>, one inside another , prefectly valid

   CHECK IT:
   if im using a useContext for a variable abc, then while passing it in the <UserContext.Consumer> can i also pass
   other variables (different than abc)
