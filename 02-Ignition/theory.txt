    - git add .
    - git commit -m "message"

Most imp package in our app is a bundler , like: vite, parcel, webpack  etc
    -packages apps to be able to push to production
    -like: create-react-app uses webpack
    -we'll be using parcel

Package Versioning:
      - two ways, and differ in updation on a new version:
          -"parcel": "^2.16.3"    (^ is caret, it will automatically do minor updates)
          -"parcel": "~2.16.3"    (~ is tilde, it will automatically do major updates too)

      - package.json vs package-lock.json:
          -.json remains exatc same, even on updation of version              :::> ^1.0.0
          -lock.json changes to new version after updating the library        :::>  1.0.0 - no tilde or caret

      - dependencies of dependencies of dependencies ... => "transitive dependencies"
