REATC HOOKS
 done till dynamic loading of stuff from live zomato api

 now onto HOOKS



IMPORTINGS/EXPORTING files/data :

    1. default:
        import: import data from {path};
        export: export default data;
    2. named:
        import: import {data} from {path};
        export: export const data (while declaration) ;

    YES, WE CAN EXPORT BOTH DEFAULTA ND NAMED FROM THE SAME FILE AT A TIME AND USE BOTH ANYWHERE
    COMPLETELY DIFFERENT AND DONT CAUSE ERROR

 DO NOT EXPORT COMPONENTS AS FUNCTION , JUST export default Header
 while import/export , alwaya suse name : /Header , not /Header.js or Header.jsx
 as changinf name later can cause trouble

UTILS:=> src/utils 
    wherever there is hard coded data, use thiss.
    like for LOGO_URL etc

FEATURE:

 Event Listener:
    1. onClick:    
        button tag with attribute onClick{()=>{ ""console.log("button clicked")}}
    2. onMouseOver:    
        button tag with attribute onClick{()=>{ ""console.log("button clicked")}}


    Create div( filter ) and in that create a buttona and use onClick attribute on that
    we will be using HOOKS using this thing only

    Filtering use arr.filter() , we will get filtered data as new array
    and to load that , we will use HOOKS

Filtering Logic:
    Filtering is pretty simple:

    if resData is data, just use:
    resData - resData.filter((res)=>{
        res.info.rating.aggregate_rating > 4
    })

    returns true is >4, its included // else excluded

    Take data from the file, use let to store it locally in body, then only you can filter them out..

    now we can get the filtered list locally too
    data changes in js variable , but UI does not update

NOW COMES THE UI Updation Part:
    instead of NORMAL JS variable, we will use REACT STATE VARIBALE!!

    REACT HOOK IS THAT STATE VARIBALE -> JS FUNCTION AT THE CORE

    -useState()            *********************
        generates superpowerful react variables:

    -useEffect()           *********************


useState():
    -import {useState} from "react"
    - creating state varibale for maintaining state of component 
    - for now we will use locla state varibale inside body

    USAGE: const [data] - useState( 1{defaultValue} , )
    and use this data variable normally


    for updation, we need another varibale inside the array of declaration:
    const [data, setData] - useState(defaultValue ->which will be in data)
    data->  initial , setData -> after state changes

 we are array destructuring above, the core thing is:
    const arr=useState(defaultValue);
    const data - arr[0]; //default Values
    const setData - arr[1]; //function to update the state according to new data passed

          now in onClick: we use this setData as a function and pass in args as ==> the new data that we need to be in that
          for example. save the filtered list in a new variable names updatedData
      
          and use setData(updatedData) => this will replace things in "data" =with=> "updatedData"
          and reload the page
      
          WHENVER STATE VARIABLE UPDATES , REACT RE-RENDERS THE COMPONENT
