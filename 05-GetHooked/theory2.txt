Reconsiliation Algorithm (React Fiber)  => finds DIFF and UPDATES DOM

    if form 7 card, we're filtering to 3 cards our UI changes
    
    from the DOM, react creates "VIRTUAL DOM" ie representation of actual DOM   
                (actual DOM = object that is being rendered)


DIFF ALGORITHM:
    finds out difference bw 2 virtual DOMS
        difference in previous virtual DOM(7 elements) and new virtual DOM(3 elements)
        and then it updates the actual DOM


Q. WHY REACT IS FAST?
A. "USES INCREMENTAL RENDERING"
