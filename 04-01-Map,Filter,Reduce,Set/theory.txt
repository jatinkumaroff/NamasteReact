used for higher order functions:
    -map        => to transform an array : [5,4,6,7]  -> double : [10,8,12,14]  etc
    -filter     => filter values in an array according to condition
    -reduce     => taking , iterating over every value in array and a single value as result.


MAP:
    pass a transformation function inside arr.map(function)
    this function will take each value inside map one by one and will return something 
    the array element will be replaced by the returned thing from transformation function.

    we can write it in following ways:
        1.  function transform(x){
               return x*2;
            }

            const double=arr.map(transform); 

        2.  const double=arr.map((x)=>{
                return x*2
            })


FILTER:
    pass an evalutaion function inside arr.filter(function)
    this function will take each value inside map one by one and will return TRUE/FALSE according to condition 
      if true-> element is kept
      if false-> element is removed

    we can write it in following ways:
        1.  function check(x){
               return x%2;
            }

            const double=arr.filter(check); 

        2.  const double=arr.filter((x)=>{
                return x%2
            })


REDUCE:
    an evalutaion function inside arr.reduce with two args:
            arr.reduce(function(acc,curr)=>{     } , initial)
            acc- accumilator , where the result stores
            curr- current element
            initial- initial value of accumilator.
    this function will take each value inside arr one by one and will keep adding(or whatever operations) the value in acc
    we can write it in following ways:
        1.  function sum(acc,curr){
               acc=acc+curr;            // performing operation with current element
               return acc;              // returning the result accumulated till now
            }

            const double=arr.filter(sum,0); 

SET:
    an evalutaion function inside arr.reduce with two args:
            arr.reduce(function(acc,curr)=>{     } , initial)
            acc- accumilator , where the result stores
            curr- current element
            initial- initial value of accumilator.
    this function will take each value inside arr one by one and will keep adding(or whatever operations) the value in acc
    we can write it in following ways:
        1.  function sum(acc,curr){
               acc=acc+curr;            // performing operation with current element
               return acc;              // returning the result accumulated till now
            }

            const double=arr.filter(sum,0); 



THESE FUNCTIONS CAN BE CHAINED TOO!!
