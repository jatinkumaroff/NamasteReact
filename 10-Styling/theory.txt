STYLING(CSS) -> Using a CSS Framework (Tailwind css here)

 SASS -> Syntatically Awesome style sheets -> advanced CSS          not scalable
 Styled Components -> used in industry                              scalable

 we will use tailwind installed and not using cdn
    1. install tailwind using official site (postcss is something that transforms css with js, not out concern , tailwind uses it in backend)
    2. 



    in case of tailwind, if a class is not present, then :
     w-[200px] = even if 200px is not available, it will give hard coded 200px

   parcel dont import the whole tailwind css, only includes the attributes that are used
   this keeps bundle size small, making it ultra lightweight

   whatever we write as tailwind styling are used as classes, like px-2, at backend is a class, that goes like:
   px-2{
      padding: 2rem 0;
   }

   now only these classes are included and not the whole lot of availble classes, but just used
   (this inclusion of not used things is called BLOATING)


DARK MODE FEATURE:

    dark:abcd , abcd is performed when mode is dark



CONDITIONAL STYLING:

 for using prop1 and prop2 on hover, :
 <.....  hover:prop1 hover:prop2>         => mentiion differently
